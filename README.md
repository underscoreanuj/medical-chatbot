This is your personal health companion. It can help you if you feel unwell by asking about your symptoms so you can check 
for any medical conditions associated with them. The chatbot aims to help those who are out-of-reach for any human medical help.
It can help the patient decide if he should be heading to a specialist.

The aim of the project was to build a mobile application connected to a backend application which acts
as an interface to a third party service. The mobile application is written in Java and the backend is written in Golang.
Both communicate via an API.
