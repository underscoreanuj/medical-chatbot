# Android Medical Assistant ![alt text](https://github.com/zemahran/android-medical-assistant/blob/master/infermedica-icon.png "Symptomate")

This is your personal health companion. It can help you if you feel unwell by asking about your symptoms so you can check 
for any medical conditions associated with them. The chatbot aims to help those who are out-of-reach for any human medical help.
It can help the patient decide if he should be heading to a specialist.

The aim of the project was to build a mobile application connected to a backend application which acts
as an interface to a third party service. The mobile application is written in Java and the backend is written in Golang.
Both communicate via an API.

[Infermedica](https://developer.infermedica.com/) is the API on which the assistant operates. Infermedica is 
an API for patient preliminary medical diagnosis. It utilizes an AI inference engine to analyze the data 
and provide a list of likely conditions and relevant observations. The engine makes it easy for the 
patient to interact with the app in natural unprocessed wording.
